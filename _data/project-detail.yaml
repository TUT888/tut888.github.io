    - name: Audio Trimmer Tool
      type: Tool with Python
      team: Personal
      git: https://github.com/TUT888/ToolsWithPython/tree/ui
      description: >-
        This project is an audio trimming tool, built using the Pydub library, designed to cut a single audio file into a shorter segment or split it into multiple files. 
        The original purpose of this program is to streamline the trimming process for long audio files by using an input audio file and trimming information stored in a text file. 
        This eliminates the need for manual trimming, saving, and renaming of each output file, as the necessary details are already specified in the text file.
      tech: 
        - Python
        - Pydub
        - Tkinter
      tag:
        - OOP
        - Programming
      contribution:
        - Developed an audio trimming tool to convert a single audio file into one or multiple output files.
        - Organized and refactored project code and structure for improved efficiency (in progress).
        - Built a user interface using Tkinter for selecting input audio and specifying output details (in progress).
