---

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, during which I acquired a broad range of technical skills across various computer science fields, 
as well as valuable soft skills. Specializing in Intelligent Computing, I developed expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). 
In addition to this, I gained foundational knowledge in software engineering, with a particular focus on web and mobile development. 
Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology, where I am further refining and expanding my software engineering skills to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.

I firmly believe that combining software engineering with expertise in AI and ML has the potential to drive innovation and create valuable, 
impactful software solutions that benefit society. 
By merging these fields, I aim to develop technology that not only advances the industry but also addresses real-world challenges.
